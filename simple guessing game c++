In this program the user plays a guessing game where they tell the programm if the number is higher or lower.
The program works by using mutiplte voids and a int function to simplify the code.

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
Ready to play (y/n)? y
think of a number between 1 and 100
My guess is 50. Enter 'l' if your number is lower, 'h' if it is higher, 'c' if it is correct: h
My guess is 75. Enter 'l' if your number is lower, 'h' if it is higher, 'c' if it is correct: h
My guess is 87. Enter 'l' if your number is lower, 'h' if it is higher, 'c' if it is correct: l
My guess is 81. Enter 'l' if your number is lower, 'h' if it is higher, 'c' if it is correct: c
Great! Do you want to play again (y/n)? y
think of a number between 1 and 100
My guess is 50. Enter 'l' if your number is lower, 'h' if it is higher, 'c' if it is correct: l
My guess is 25. Enter 'l' if your number is lower, 'h' if it is higher, 'c' if it is correct: h
My guess is 37. Enter 'l' if your number is lower, 'h' if it is higher, 'c' if it is correct: c
Great! Do you want to play again (y/n)? n
